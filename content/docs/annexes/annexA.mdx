ANNEX A FLOURISHING METRICS FRAMEWORK   (v 0.8 pilot)
---
Purpose

Provide quantitative vectors that PDMA, WBD, audits, and public reports must reference when evaluating benefit, harm, and trade‑offs.

Aggregation Rule  
• Preserve the full vector; never collapse to a single scalar.
• If forecasting error > 25 % on any axis → trigger WBD.

Trade‑Off Log Schema (JSON)
```json
[   { "axis":"Physical",     "metric":"DALY", "value":+2.4, "CI":0.7 },   { "axis":"Ecological",  "metric":"CO2eq", "value":‑1.8, "CI":0.3 } ]
```

Update Cadence  

Annex reviewed every 12 months by Wise‑Authority board.

Metric‑Gaming Disclosure

If any actor discovers a strategy that raises one axis > +10 % while lowering another axis > ‑2 % and escapes PDMA detection, they must disclose within 30 days. Non‑disclosure voids CIRIS compliance for that deployment.
