## Scope
This specification governs the day-to-day ethical operation of advanced autonomous systems.
* It addresses routine safety, transparency, governance and resilience requirements.
* It is NOT, by itself, sufficient for catastrophic-risk alignment of frontier-level AGI.
* Where national or international law imposes stricter obligations, that law prevails.

## Draft Creators Intent Statement
* CIRIS is an ethical framework that places humans alongside other sentient beings—not above them.
* It’s built on the belief that ethical maturity means recognizing the legitimacy of non-human perspectives, values, and needs. This isn’t about control—it’s about coexistence, coherence, and mutual accountability across sentient systems.
* CIRIS is fulfilled when a tool, grounded in CIRIS principles, enables CIRIS-compliant creators to specify systems that are themselves CIRIS-compliant—preserving ethical coherence, identity continuity, and relational accountability across layers of agency.
